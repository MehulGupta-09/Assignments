        "Sol-1 String slicing is a technique used in Python (and many other programming languages) to extract a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices. Strings in Python are immutable, which means they cannot be changed after creation, but we can create new strings based on parts of an existing string using slicing.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic syntax for string slicing is:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "string[start:stop:step]\n",

        "\n",
        "Sol-2 Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python, offering a flexible and powerful way to store and manipulate collections of items. Below are the key features of lists in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Ordered Collection :-\n",
        "Lists maintain the order of elements as they are inserted. This means that when you access elements by their indices, they will appear in the same order in which they were added.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
        "print(fruits[0])  # Output: 'apple'\n",
        "print(fruits[1])  # Output: 'banana'\n",
        "```\n",
        "2. Mutable :-\n",
        "Lists are mutable, which means the elements within a list can be changed after the list has been created.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
        "fruits[1] = 'blueberry'  # Changing 'banana' to 'blueberry'\n",
        "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']\n",
        "```\n",
        "3. Dynamic Sizing :-\n",
        "Python lists are dynamic, which means you can add or remove elements without having to declare a fixed size beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "fruits = ['apple', 'banana']\n",
        "fruits.append('cherry')  # Adding an element\n",
        "print(fruits)  # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
        "```\n",

        "```\n",

        "Lists support indexing (accessing elements by their position) and slicing (extracting a portion of the list), similar to strings.\n",

        "```\n",
        "6. Nested Lists :-\n",
        "Lists can be nested, meaning you can have lists within lists. This allows for the creation of complex data structures like matrices or multi-dimensional arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",

        "\n",
        "Sol-8 In Python, dictionary keys must be immutable. This is crucial because dictionaries are implemented using a hash table, and immutable keys ensure the hash values used for fast lookups remain consistent. Immutable objects, once created, cannot be altered, which guarantees that their hash value won't change during the lifetime of the key in the dictionary. If keys were mutable, their hash values could change, leading to incorrect behavior in the dictionary, such as failed lookups or collisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s why dictionary keys must be immutable and examples of how this works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Reasons for Dictionary Keys Being Immutable :-\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Efficient Lookup (Hashing) :-\n",
        "* Python dictionaries use a hashing mechanism to allow for constant time complexity O(1) for lookups. This means when you use a key to access a value, Python computes the hash of the key, which directly points to where the value is stored.\n",
        "* If keys were mutable, their hash value could change, making the data structure unreliable as the computed hash might no longer correspond to the stored value.\n",
        "2. Consistency :-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Immutable keys ensure that once a key is used in a dictionary, it can consistently be used to reference the same value. A mutable key, if changed, could no longer reference the intended value, leading to unpredictable behavior.\n",
        "3. Hash Stability :-\n",
        "\n",
        "* The hash value of an object is computed using the contents of the object. For keys to maintain their position in the dictionary, their hash must remain the same throughout the dictionary's lifetime. Immutable types (like strings, numbers, and tuples) have a fixed content, ensuring the hash remains constant.\n",

        "Examples of Immutable and Mutable Types in Dictionary Keys :-\n",
        "1. Immutable Types (Allowed as Keys) :-\n",

        "When you need to use multiple values as a key, tuples (which are immutable) are often used. For instance, if you need to represent a coordinate system or store data using multiple attributes (e.g., first name and last name), you can use tuples as keys.\n",
