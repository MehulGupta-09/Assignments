        "\n",
        "Sol-1 Python is widely regarded as one of the most popular programming languages due to its versatility, simplicity, and power. The key features that contribute to its popularity are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Easy-to-Read and Write Syntax:\n",
        "Python’s clean and readable syntax reduces the learning curve, especially for beginners. Its code structure is straightforward, focusing on readability, which makes it easier to write and maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Interpreted Language:\n",
        "Python is an interpreted language, meaning that you can run the code line-by-line without the need for compiling it first. This allows for quick testing, prototyping, and easier debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Dynamically Typed:\n",
        "Python doesn’t require variable types to be declared. The type of variable is determined at runtime, making the language more flexible.\n",
        "Example :-\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "x = 10  # Integer\n",
        "y = \"Python\"  # String\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Extensive Standard Library:\n",
        "Python comes with a rich standard library that covers many areas, such as file handling, regular expressions, threading, web development, and much more. Example :- Flask, Django, Pandas, Numpy, Mathplotlib, Turtle, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Support for Multiple Programming Paradigms:\n",
        "Python supports different programming paradigms, including:\n",
        "\n",

        "  *   Procedural Programming: Writing code in simple sequences of instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Scalability and Performance:\n",
        "While Python is not the fastest language, it can scale to handle large projects. Through the use of libraries like Cython or integrating with compiled languages like C, Python can achieve performance optimization where necessary.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Versatility Across Domains:\n",
        "Python is used in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, automation, scientific computing, and more.\n",
        "\n",
        "These features make Python a preferred language across a wide range of industries, including data science, web development, AI/ML, automation, and more.\n"

        "**Sol-5** Type casting or type conversion refers to converting one data type into another. Python provides two types of type casting:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Implicit Type Casting :-\n",
        "In implicit type casting, Python automatically converts one data type to another without user intervention when it is safe to do so. This usually happens when converting a smaller data type (e.g., integer) to a larger one (e.g., float).\n",

        "Example of Implicit Type Casting:\n",
        "```\n",

        "#Here, num_int (integer) is implicitly converted to a float when added to num_float, and the result is a float.\n",
        "```\n",
        "2. Explicit Type Casting :-\n",
        "In explicit type casting, you manually convert one data type into another using casting functions. Common type casting functions include:\n",
