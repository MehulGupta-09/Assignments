        "\n",
        "Sol-1 In Python, functions and methods are both callable objects that perform actions, but they differ primarily in how they are associated with objects and how they are called. Here are the main differences:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Function :-\n",
        "\n",
        "* Definition: A function is a block of code that is designed to perform a specific task. It can be defined using the def keyword and can exist independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Association: Functions are not tied to any object. They can be called independently without being associated with a particular class or object.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Syntax: You call a function directly by its name: function_name().\n",

        "\n",
        "* Association: Methods are defined inside classes and are called on objects (instances of that class). The first parameter of a method is usually self (which refers to the instance).\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Memory Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Generators don't store all values in memory at once; they generate items on-the-fly, one at a time. This is especially useful when working with large datasets or infinite sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Example: Instead of returning a list with a million items, a generator produces one item at a time, saving memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Improved Performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Since generators yield values one at a time, they can start producing results without waiting for the entire computation to finish, which leads to faster initial response times.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Particularly useful when dealing with streaming data or real-time processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Statefulness Without Complexity:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Generators automatically maintain state between iterations without needing explicit state management code (like in loops or classes). The function \"pauses\" at each yield and resumes where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This simplifies coding for scenarios where partial results are needed in each iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Lazy Evaluation:\n",

        "* Generators compute values only when needed, reducing unnecessary computations. Regular functions, on the other hand, process and return all values immediately.\n",
        "\n",
